# Redis AI Datatsets

RedisAI is a Redis module for executing Deep Learning/Machine Learning models and managing their data. Its purpose is being a "workhorse" for model serving, by providing out-of-the-box support for popular DL/ML frameworks and unparalleled performance. RedisAI both simplifies the deployment and serving of graphs by leveraging on Redis' production-proven infrastructure, as well as maximizes computation throughput by adhering to the principle of data locality.

AI creates new data-layer challenges for organizations, including handling the proliferation and complexity of inference data. Requiring no added infrastructure, RedisAI allows you to run your inference engine where the data lives, decreasing latency and increasing simplicityâ€”all coupled with the core Redis Enterprise features.

Because Redis is an extendable in-memory data structures server, RedisAI uses it for storing its machine learning (ML) native data types. The main data type supported by RedisAI is the tensor, which is the common representation of ML data.
